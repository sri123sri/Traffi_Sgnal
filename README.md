                               Adaptable Traffic Signal Control System
ABSTRACT:
Adaptable traffic signal control system project is a software-based solution that is designed to 
manage the traffic signals at an intersection in a city. The system is intended to optimize traffic 
flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall safety. The project involves designing and 
developing a software system that is capable of monitoring traffic in real-time, controlling 
traffic signals based on vehicle density. The system will use a control algorithm to optimize 
the traffic signal timings, ensuring that traffic flows smoothly and efficiently. The system will 
collect and analyze data on traffic and this information will be used to adjust the traffic signal 
timings and the system will helps in reduce the wasting time. The system will also be able to 
integrate with other systems, such as traffic cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the 
traffic conditions. Overall, the traffic signal management system project aims to create a more 
efficient, safe, and reliable traffic management system that can help reduce traffic congestion
